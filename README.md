## EthicalAI
Goal is to capture understanding of ethics of AI, guidelines, ecosystem around that!!

- Risk in deployment:
  - Bias (Dataset does not reflect facial recognition not working properly for example)
  - Fairness, History dataset is reality or not
  - Unethical aspects / Unfair usage

- Regulatory aspects:
  - Region specific needs (e.g. GDPR etc.)
  
- Provide clarity as much as possible 
  - What is happening from Step 1 to Step N
  - Features used during feature engineering process
  - Any information regarding feature importance / Top N features (as per applicability)

## Machine Learning Roadmap

- Focus on every stages in the ML journey
- Critical to highlight on detailing and what tasks are performed in a step wise manner
