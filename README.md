## EthicalAI
Goal is to capture understanding of ethics of AI, guidelines, ecosystem around that.

Category|Description
--------|-----------
**Risk in deployment** | <ul><li> 1: Bias (Dataset does not reflect facial recognition not working properly for example)<li> 2: Fairness, History dataset is reality or not<li> 3: Unethical aspects or Unfair usage</ul>
**Regulatory aspects** | <ul><li> 1: Region specific needs (e.g. GDPR etc.)</ul>
**Provide clarity as much as possible** | <ul><li> 1: What is happening from Step 1 to Step N<li> 2: Features used during feature engineering process<li> 3: Any information regarding feature importance / Top N features (as per applicability)</ul>
**How to approach Bias in AI** | <ul> <li> 1. Gather more diverse datasets <li> 2. Explore to include labels from a wider range of judges <li> 3. Monitor output of models / experiments / algorithms <li> 4. Focus on small categories and edge cases <li> 4. Laws and Regulation protocol may be required to address bias </ul>

### Principles from the Ethical Institute

The Ethical institute has recommended following principles
- Human Augmentation
- Bias Evaluation
- Explainability by Justification
- Reproducible Operations
- Displacement Strategy
- Practical Accuracy
- Trust by Privacy
- Security Risks

As per HBR (Harvard Business review), the ethical frameworks for AI aren't enough. [Check Here](https://hbr.org/2020/11/ethical-frameworks-for-ai-arent-enough)

## Machine Learning Roadmap

- Focus on every stages in the ML journey
- Critical to highlight on detailing and what tasks are performed in a step wise manner

## Why do we need ML Interpretability?

- Some questions pertaining to Model bias, fairness, ethics
- Do we check causality of features? Does more data help here making better decision?
- Do we have ability to debug and know more specifics
- Are there any regulatory requirements associated with and needs to be understood in detail?
- Do we trust model's outcomes and to what extent?
- Do we have a segregation of critical domain vs non-critical domain that can be defined?
